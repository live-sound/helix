The associated PDF files are extracts from the Helix Air DIY Web site. They provide the details for constructing the Helix AIR DIY Cables

There have been no updates since 2022 and I have no plans to enhance their designs any further.

The designs are open to any DIYer that wishes to try the Helix AIR designs and modify those designs as they wish

They offer superior performance to many high end branded products for a ruction of the price 

Please take note of the various warning, especially where power cables are concerned.

The cables will NOT damage audio equipment but failure to take note of the carious warning will result in poor performance.

Happy Diying
